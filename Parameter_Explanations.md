# Main.py Parameters Explanation

This document provides an explanation for each parameter in the `Main.py` script. It covers what each parameter is, the possible values, and the implications of high and low values.

## Parameters

### `ratings_file`
- **Description**: The path to the CSV file containing the ratings data.
- **Possible Values**: A string representing the file path.
- **Notes**: Ensure the file exists at the specified path before running the script.

### `batch_size`
- **Description**: The number of samples processed before the model is updated.
- **Possible Values**: Integer values (e.g., 32, 64, 128).
- **High Value**: Larger batch sizes can provide more stable gradient estimates but require more memory and computational resources.

### `generator_existence_gen_size`
- **Description**: The size of the hidden layer in the existence generation part of the generator.
- **Possible Values**: Integer values (e.g., 2000).
- **High Value**: Larger sizes can improve the model's capacity but require more computational resources.

### `discriminator_fc1_size`
- **Description**: The size of the first fully connected layer in the discriminator.
- **Possible Values**: Integer values (e.g., 512, 1024).
- **High Value**: Larger sizes can enhance the discriminator's capacity to differentiate real from fake data but increase computational complexity.
- **Low Value**: Smaller sizes are computationally cheaper but may limit the discriminator's capacity.

### `discriminator_main_sizes`
- **Description**: List specifying the sizes of hidden layers in the main part of the discriminator.
- **Possible Values**: List of integer values (e.g., [256, 256]).
- **High Value**: Larger sizes can improve the discriminator's capacity to model complex patterns but increase computational demands.
- **Low Value**: Smaller sizes reduce computational load but may lead to underfitting.

### `discriminator_dropout_rate`
- **Description**: The dropout rate for the discriminator.
- **Possible Values**: Float values between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.3, 0.5).
- **High Value**: Higher dropout rates can help prevent overfitting but may slow down the learning process.
- **Low Value**: Lower dropout rates may speed up learning but increase the risk of overfitting.

### `learning_rate_G`
- **Description**: Learning rate for the generator's optimizer.
- **Possible Values**: Float values (e.g., 0.0001, 0.0002).
- **High Value**: Higher learning rates can speed up convergence but may cause instability.
- **Low Value**: Lower learning rates provide more stable updates but may slow down convergence.

### `learning_rate_D`
- **Description**: Learning rate for the discriminator's optimizer.
- **Possible Values**: Float values (e.g., 0.0001, 0.0002).
- **High Value**: Higher learning rates can speed up convergence but may cause instability.
- **Low Value**: Lower learning rates provide more stable updates but may slow down convergence.

### `betas`
- **Description**: Betas for the Adam optimizer.
- **Possible Values**: Tuple of two float values (e.g., (0.5, 0.999)).
- **High Value**: Higher beta values can lead to slower adaptation of the learning rate.
- **Low Value**: Lower beta values can result in faster adaptation but may lead to noisy updates.

### `num_epochs`
- **Description**: The number of epochs for training.
- **Possible Values**: Integer values (e.g., 20, 50, 100).
- **High Value**: More epochs allow the model to learn more but increase training time.
- **Low Value**: Fewer epochs reduce training time but may lead to underfitting.

### `verbose`
- **Description**: Verbose level for logging.
- **Possible Values**: Integer values (e.g., 0, 1).
- **High Value**: Higher verbosity (e.g., 1) provides more detailed logs.
- **Low Value**: Lower verbosity (e.g., 0) provides fewer logs, focusing on essential information.
